My goal is it to have a combination of blindbit scan and blindbit-wallet-cli as a (simple) desktop application. Ideally I am able to reuse the code from blindbit scan and blindbit wallet cli and the other blinbdit repos. 

The goal:

- Allows the user to do what can be done with each blindbit scan and blindbit-wallet-cli in one app
	- Scanning, setup calls to blindbit scan type function can be automated as the scan and spend key are known to the application through the wallet part
	- Absolut minimum: see coins, see address, spend coins and obvioulsy creation of wallets (seeds etc.)
- Have a simple (ideally modern and nice looking) GUI 
- GO code should be reused and not written from scratch
- Cross platform
- Preferably none of the frameworks which spin up an entire browser and are A huge in disk space and B take up a lot of memory while running
